									<p>Hi there! Let me introduce myself;My name is Juan Almer Dylan,but you can call me Dylan.</p>

						 		<p>I was born on 30 August 2000 in Bogor small town close to the capital city of Indonesia,Jakarta.Actually since i was little i didn't really understand the world of computers,but i'm very passionate and curious about something new.So when i'm 13 my parents gave me a smartphone for the first time.I was amazed by how a very small tool could contain so much information.So i started watching some tech videos around youtube platform and began to like the world of technology.</p>
								<p>When I was in High School i was saving bucks to build a computer myself ,it was the first time I build a computer although it is an system that used integrated graphics.Not satisfied with just that i'm began to start to code,it's a simple arithmetic code.Time flies very fast and i have to choose what college to major so i remembered my interest in technology despite i've never practiced coding ever since.Now I can study at Bina Nusantara University major in computer science and had no regret about it.  </p>

										<h2>About My Hobby</h2>
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/hobi.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Model Building</h3>
									<p>I gain my interest in model building more precisely in plastic model building like Gundam from Japan.I got my first piece when I was 15 and build several models.Due to Covid-19 i've got nothing to do and have a lot of time.To assemble Gundam you'll need around 3-5 hours for a basic one and around 5-10 hours for a higher grade gundam;In gundam it have levels classified by the scale.HG or high grade is 1/144,MG or master grade scales around 1/100 and so on levels like PG or perfect grade and fullsize there's even lifescale gundam in Japan.We need patience in assembling a gundam and requires concentration.I like gundam model because that model doesn't need glue att all but can be attached directly for each parts.Usually I start assembling when i have plenty of time but it's definitely worth it.  </p>
									</ul>							
								<h3>Aquascaping</h3>
								<p>I also started this hobby because Covid-19.At first I accidentally saw a video on youtube about aquascaping and terraforming.I immediately wanted to make one for me.My parents have the same hobby but they've a fish pond while i want to make aquascape so i took a fish pond pump and place it in an aquarium;Filled in the aquarium with some rocks,soil,and an aquatic plants and some neon fish.Just looking at an aquascape i fell more relaxed and because i have a lot of time i can clean and drain the tank once a week.  </p>
								<p></p>
								<h3>Pc Build</h3>
								<p>Again because covid and i have to stay at home i wasted time playing games with my friends.But nowadays some games are more demanding than i thought and my old laptop start getting hot and uncomfortable for long term session.But again because covid pc parts becomes difficult to find and prices start to skyrocket.I bought all the parts online and start to assembled thme myself;Building pc looks very difficult actually it's not that difficult.Once you build them by yourself i'm sure you can assembled others;In fact building gundam is more difficult and takes more time.  </p>
